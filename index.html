	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>The unixporn network is a Linux/Unix customization community made to fill the niche amongst other SFW *porn subreddits. We believe that the desktop interface is one of the most used tools in our day to day lives, so the customization to fit our personal workflow and style is important. Through the unixporn community we can share screenshots, get inspiration, post tutorials, share config files, and more. </p>
